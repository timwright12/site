<h1>Accessibility Beyond Compliance Playbook</h1>

<p>Copy from: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240914141206/https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/">http://web.archive.org/web/20240914141206/https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/</a></p>
<p>This playbook is for government agencies and other civic organizations looking to mature their practical understanding of accessibility from one of basic compliance to an inclusive, human-centered experience.</p>
<p>Follow our plays to better equip your organization and teams with practices that will lead to more equitable digital services.</p>
<p><em>Special thanks to Meli Manak, Angela Fowler, David Kennedy, Dan Bivins, Josh Kim, Trevor Pierce, and Noah Gelman for writing this playbook.</em></p>
<p><strong>The word accessibility has many different meanings.</strong></p>
<p>Most often, you hear it invoked from a legal perspective by government agencies and civic tech organizations. Those entities that must comply with Section 508 accessibility standards because the law requires it, and if they don’t, they might get sued. Starting from this place of fear means that you center the legal ramifications of accessibility and not the people it benefits.</p>
<p><strong>At (redacted), we believe that compliance is a result, not the objective.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we use an Accessibility Beyond Compliance mindset to approach accessibility from the perspective of real human experiences. This allows us to go beyond the limitations of legal compliance with the intent of designing a more inclusive and equitable future for disabled people.</p>
<p>We see accessibility as a duty in our mission to better serve people. We believe in the social model of disability, defined here by Scope, which means we hold responsibility to ensure our products and services do not create or contribute to systemic barriers, derogatory attitudes, or social exclusion.</p>
<h2 id="adopting-an-accessibility-beyond-compliance-mindset-means:" tabindex="-1">Adopting an Accessibility Beyond Compliance mindset means: <a class="direct-link" href="#adopting-an-accessibility-beyond-compliance-mindset-means:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Gaining leadership support. Leaders at all levels prioritize accessibility and strive to bring those affected by accessibility work into the product creation process.</li>
<li>Embedding inclusive processes into all parts of the organization. Creating experiences that a wide range of people can use happens with intentional processes and coordinated teamwork. Everyone has a part to play, and real progress comes when examining how work happens and how inclusivity can be built into a team’s process.</li>
<li>Establishing an ongoing educational system for learning about accessibility. Putting time and money into learning about accessibility for people in all parts of the organization.</li>
<li>Framing accessibility conversations around the human experience. Approaching accessibility from how it impacts people when thinking about it, talking about it, and putting it into practice. This forces your organization to approach accessibility as a human-centered design problem and not as a quality assurance problem.</li>
<li>Fostering inclusive workplaces for disabled representation. Investing in the technological, cultural, and organizational work necessary to grow inclusive workplaces that attract and retain people with disabilities. Workplaces that have an equitable representation of disabled people help break down systemic barriers and normalize perspectives around access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our playbook is designed to explore several ways to improve accessibility — thinking not just in terms of outputs, but outcomes for your organization overall. These can be thought of as concentric circles of maturity, from the immediate task of building accessible products all the way to creating teams of people that underscore an Accessibility Beyond Compliance approach.</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong>: Ensure you have processes in place to deliver accessible products.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting systems</strong>: Build accessibility into your support systems to enable accessible products.</p>
<p><strong>Goals and constraints</strong>: Consider constraints and set goals as an organization to ensure you deliver systems and products that are accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Maturing teams</strong>: Think about building Accessibility Beyond Compliance into not just your products, systems, or goals, but into the organization itself.</p>
<p><strong>A note on language</strong></p>
<p>We’ve decided to use both people-first language (people with disabilities) and identity-first language (disabled people) to recognize that both are valid and advocated for within the disability community.</p>

<h3 id="design-with-an-accessibility-first-mindset" tabindex="-1">Design with an accessibility-first mindset <a class="direct-link" href="#design-with-an-accessibility-first-mindset" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Designing with an accessibility-first mindset means focusing on people with disabilities as early and often as possible in the design process through rounds of iteration. It requires a design team to be intentional about addressing and prioritizing the needs and preferences of disabled people and other historically marginalized and underserved groups.</p>
<h4 id="play-1-checklist" tabindex="-1">Play 1 Checklist <a class="direct-link" href="#play-1-checklist" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<h5 id="ideation:" tabindex="-1">Ideation: <a class="direct-link" href="#ideation:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Set up ideation and/or design thinking workshops to use accessible methods and tools with the intention of including and centering people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Frame ideation around functionality and accessibility before delight and aesthetics.</li>
<li>Review all ideas that will be translated into prototypes with an accessibility specialist.</li>
<li>Include diverse perspectives and experiences in user stories, models, and artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="prototyping:" tabindex="-1">Prototyping: <a class="direct-link" href="#prototyping:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Include proactive solutions for issues and concerns raised in research with disabled people (play 2).</li>
<li>Design for mobile and assistive technologies first before designing for non-assistive needs.</li>
<li>Design for multiple input modes including speech, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and more.</li>
<li>Annotate design artifacts like wireframes and mockups to help developers create accessible  solutions. For example, noting heading levels, writing alt text, and identifying ARIA patterns.</li>
<li>Write content and use images that are inclusive and/or representative of a diverse range of abilities.</li>
<li>Ensure language is easy to understand at a grade 7 level or below and contains only what someone may need to complete their task.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="testing:" tabindex="-1">Testing: <a class="direct-link" href="#testing:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Complete an accessibility review with an accessibility specialist ahead of conducting usability testing with real users.</li>
<li>Design prototypes to be usable by assistive technologies when conducting usability tests. For example, using CodePen to create an HTML prototype.</li>
<li>Test products with people with disabilities across a range of assistive technologies, devices, and experiences as early and as often as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="play-1-key-questions" tabindex="-1">Play 1 Key questions <a class="direct-link" href="#play-1-key-questions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>How might we design for accessibility before delight?</li>
<li>Have we considered users who may not have a mobile device, high-speed internet connection, or reliable access to digital services?</li>
<li>How might we intentionally frame ideation, prototyping, and testing around historically marginalized and underserved communities?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="play-1-common-barriers" tabindex="-1">Play 1 Common barriers <a class="direct-link" href="#play-1-common-barriers" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can’t test with disabled people because our team is structured around testing in Figma, Sketch, or other inaccessible prototyping tools.<br>
<strong>Counterplay</strong>: Consider using rapid CodePen prototypes or contextual “think aloud” studies (Nielsen Norman Group).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a remote organization, we can’t test with people with slow internet connections.<br>
<strong>Counterplay</strong>: Consider if you need to have a video of the participant while testing. A phone call or messaging app may be more accessible to some participants. Alternatively, consider collecting feedback asynchronously through a diary study or survey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
