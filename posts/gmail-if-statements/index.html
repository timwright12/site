<p>Last night I went to the Celtics/Clippers game in LA. Boston lost, but it was a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/timwright12/2009CelticsClippers#">great game</a>; right down to the wire. Anyway, that's not the purpose of this write–up.</p>
<p>When I got home, I uploaded the pictures and e–mailed them out to my family (as I do). I sent them out to dad, mom, sister, and my uncle.</p>
<p>I wrote out the e–mail, and at the end I wanted to thank my Uncle for the tickets, but I thought it would be weird for the rest of the people to see &quot;Thanks for the tickets uncle Jim&quot; at the bottom of the e–mail. So instead, I wrote a second e–mail thanking for the tickets. I know e–mail is pretty &quot;green&quot;, but I found this to be a very fixable issue to save that second e–mail from clogging up inboxes.</p>
<p>This actually happens to me quite a bit for some reason, and most of the time I just don't send the second e–mail. So I got to thinking and I'd like it if GMail (the masters of web they are) could implement some sort of conditional statement to section off an e–mail.</p>
<h5 id="the-gmail-if-statement:" tabindex="-1">The GMail If Statement: <a class="direct-link" href="#the-gmail-if-statement:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h5>
<pre><code>{if:recipient=&quot;myuncle@example.com&quot;}
Thanks for the tickets!
{/if}
</code></pre>
<p>I could have e–mailed Google about this, but in the past that's never worked so I thought I'd write something up and turn to the community about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think this is a cool idea, if you agree and think it's a feature that could benefit you in GMail, please leave a comment, share, <a href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.csskarma.com/blog/gmail-if-statements/">digg</a>, whatever. And maybe it'll make it's way back to Google.</p>
<p>Even if it's only applicable to GMail recipients, could be cool and a simple feature to add in. I'd rather see it as a GMail feature than a Greasemonkey script, but hey... I'd use it either way!</p>
