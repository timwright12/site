So I discovered a new show on WGN ay midnight called "Corner Gas". It's about a Saskatchewan town and the people in it. Very strange show, a lot of dry humor, so naturally I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame. It's basically a town filled with really stupid people, but it's not dumb and dumber type humor; it's very different. I highly recommend it, especially for Tivo/DVR.

On a related note, I'm really starting to develop quite a hatred for Time Warner digital cable and their crappy equipment. I think I'm going to switch over to dissh network since they have the free HD upgrade...

I never seem to have anything interesting to say, frankly....I'm not 100% sure why I have a blog. Probably because it came with the domain, but it doesn't work well with the regular website style (displaying code).

ah well, back to Corner Gas
