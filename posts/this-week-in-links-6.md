##### [Successfully Present Your Web Designs to Clients](http://www.dave-woods.co.uk/index.php/successfully-present-your-web-designs-to-clients/)

Dave Woods put together a nice article in response to Andy Clarke's article on [static visuals](http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals/). I'm linking this one up because I think a lot have already read Andy's and I think Dave did a nice job on this one.

##### [Feature your Products with jQuery](http://blog.position-absolute.com/javascript-jquery/jquery-featured-products-animation-now-it-look-cool/)

This is a cool jQuery trick from a blog I just started reading a couple weeks ago.

##### [Writing Maintainable CSS](http://www.slideshare.net/nataliedowne/css-systems-presentation)

Unfortunately, my link posts are a little backed up right now, so this is probably a week old at this point. But it's a direct link to the slide show on writing maintainable CSS. I disagree with some of it, but overall, a good presentation.

##### [Space Madness](http://arielwaldman.com/2008/09/23/space-madness-in-social-media/)

Ariel is, from what I can gather, awesome, and a consultant for NASA. In this post she described how Twitter is being used on Neptune!
