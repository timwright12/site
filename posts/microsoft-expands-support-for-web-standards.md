Ran into this link today, thought I'd share: [Microsoft Standards](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/mar08/03-03WebStandards.mspx)

#### My thoughts

Looks like the IE team created a really complex system to account for all the uproar in the web community. Seems to be a large step in the right direction. [Didn't someone say this would happen](http://www.alistapart.com/comments/minorthreat?page=5#49)?

Either way, I still think it's a good thing and I really hope Microsoft does a better job at upgrading IE7 folks to IE8 than they did for IE6 users.

Just a quick post today.
