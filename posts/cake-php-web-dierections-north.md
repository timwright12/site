**CakePHP**Â 

It's a widely believed FACT that I'm a PHP n00b. Hardcore programming is not where I make my millions; so when [Shark Cool](http://sharkcool.net/ "http://sharkcool.net/") suggested a PHP framework called [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org), my ears perked up.

When I first got to the site, I looked around, read the documentation and it all sounds great but what the hell does it do? Well, it's supposed to streamline PHP app development. Today I plan on actually reading through the whole manual and really trying to understand more about this stuff that is, apparently, all the rage. Maybe I can actually build something, I think they have a tutorial on building a forum. This should be good, I haven't done anything actually interesting at work in months.

**Vancouver**

The [Web Directions North](http://north08.webdirections.org/?aff=tiwr "http://north08.webdirections.org/?aff=tiwr") conference in Vancouver is coming up soon (Jan 28). I'm looking forward to the talk on "Developing with Adobe AIR" and presentations by [John Allsopp](http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#allsopp) & [David Shea](http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#shea), [Gina Trapani](http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#trapani) (from [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/ "http://lifehacker.com/")) and [Daniel Burka](http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#burka "http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#burka") (from [Digg](http://www.digg.com/ "Digg") & [Pownce](http://www.pownce.com "Pownce")).

It should be a really good conference and I'm excited to get a chance to poke around in Vancouver, rub elbows with some of the people on my bookshelf, and get my first passport stamp.

Currently listening to: [John Mayer Trio](http://www.johnmayertrio.com/ "http://www.johnmayertrio.com/")
