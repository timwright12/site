Just a quick heads up that I have a new article out on SitePoint. It's called "[Adapting an Interface for Touch Devices](http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/adapting-an-interface-for-touch-devices)". It introduces a new technique called "Touch detection" for building rich interactions on both touch and non-touch devices.

I also gave a talk at [Cascade LA](http://www.cascadela.com/calendar/14805000/?action=detail&eventId=14805000) a couple weeks ago called "Mobile, Media, & Touch" on the same topic (it actually goes into a little more depth). You can [view the slides on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/csskarma/mobile-media-touch)

Let me know what you think!
