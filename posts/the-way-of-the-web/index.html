<p>I've been in web development for a couple years now, mostly behind the scenes CSS coding (which I dig), so I've worked with quite a few different designers that basically email me a jpg or psd of what they want a site to look like and I make it happen. I notice a trend that has started become more and more prevalent since I went to An Event Apart - Boston back in March and paid closer attention to typographic, column placement, grid layouts, and readability.</p>
<p>Call it being stuck inside the box, or whatever, but I see a lot of designers clinging onto the concept that the web should look like something tangible (book, magazine, dog, etc.). While the its considered pretty young...around 10Â years old... I think the web has been around long enough and created such a great presence for itself that it can be separated from aspects of the physical world. Of course, this doesn't concern most websites out there, but who said that <a href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a> has to look like a digital news paper. I understand the branding issues that come with making an online newspaper look like the paper version, but with the influx of XML/RSS, I don't see any reason to not have fun with designing on the web.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is my maiden post to the blog and, in a nutshell, I think there are still far too many people not using the web to its fullest potential.</p>
