- the brain has lots of distractions
- peple have different learning styles that need to be looked at

#### Research

- there's no research that says using templates & bullet points are the best way to present
- Book: Multimedia Learning
- we have assumptions about communications that we can send info and someone will receive it without a problem

#### Types of learning

- no learning
- fragmented learning
- meaningful learning
- usually stuck in fragmented learning

#### Memory

- sensory memory (unlimited)
- long term memory (unlimited)
- working memory (3-4 chunks of information retained in working memory)
- sync both visual and verbal channels of communication in a presentation
    - the speed the brain processes verbal and visual are different
- need effective information design
- present a story in a way that slims it down enough to where people can process it all

#### What turns the brain on

- meeting the brain, not just on conscious mind.
- the mind thinks something is important, but the brain disagrees
- how does the brain know what to let through it's spam filter?
    - brain cares about chemestry
    - anything that sends a little chemical signal (weird things, shocking/novel things)
    - talking to a person's instincts, eliciting a reaction to toggle memory

#### What the brain doesn't care about:

- boring dude with a computer
- code
    - adding in a strong image to code to get a reaction
- talk to the brain, not the mind

#### Retention

- combining the audio and visual toggle much better memory
- showing interaction with action, sound and animation

#### Mistakes people make in presentations

- using speaker notes (use the screen and images for speaking queues )
- Focusing on the tool, rather than what you want to do with it
- talking over text
- having too much text
    - putting text on a page forces the brain to decide between listening to you or reading the text
- bullet points are not always your best option (ask: when is it appropriate to put bullet points in a film, or put the script on the screen? â€” it's not)
- listing technique doesn't hold up against a story approach
- don't read the bullet point
- if a bullet point is wrapping on the next line, it's too long
- Book: evaluating training methods

#### How can we make actual changes to someone's behavior? not just cheap tricks.

- how you view the audience, as a presenter is important
- don't make a presentation of \[x\] better, try and make a better user of \[x\]
- don't focus on the presentation, focus on the user and how they can use the information

#### Tips

- never use templates or themes
- use pop culture (star wars example)
- ask yourself if every slide has a pulse
- use puppies
