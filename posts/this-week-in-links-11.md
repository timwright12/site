##### [CSS Deployment 101](http://reinholdweber.com/?p=37)

Reinhold Weber talks about how to compress a CSS file before you push it to the server. this will shave off some load time by reducing everything to one line and removing much of the white space. It also allows you to modularize your CSS without it effecting HTTP requests, because this script will also combine all files into one once it's on the server.

##### [Equal Height Columns with jQuery](http://www.cssnewbie.com/equal-height-columns-with-jquery/)

A very useful bit of jQuery creating equal height columns. Pretty slick integration, I'll be using this.

##### [Web Directions North](http://north.webdirections.org/)

Web Directions is a conference I went to last January, it was very cool. Possibly the best conference I've been to so far. It's coming back this February in Denver; if you have the means, I highly recommend it.
