<p>Just a quick heads up that I have a new article out on SitePoint. It's called &quot;<a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/adapting-an-interface-for-touch-devices">Adapting an Interface for Touch Devices</a>&quot;. It introduces a new technique called &quot;Touch detection&quot; for building rich interactions on both touch and non-touch devices.</p>
<p>I also gave a talk at <a href="http://www.cascadela.com/calendar/14805000/?action=detail&amp;eventId=14805000">Cascade LA</a> a couple weeks ago called &quot;Mobile, Media, &amp; Touch&quot; on the same topic (it actually goes into a little more depth). You can <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/csskarma/mobile-media-touch">view the slides on slideshare</a></p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
