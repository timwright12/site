## [FV Code Highlighter](http://www.frank-verhoeven.com/wordpress-plugin-fv-code-higlighter/)

A handy wordpress plugin for code highlighting, very cool and useful, definitely check this out if you have time. This will be the next plugin I install.

## [Hacking JavaScript for Fun and Profit](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/javascript-fun-profit-part-1/)

SitePoint is always a great place to find good tutorials. This one especially caught my eye in the past week.

## [LiveBar](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/15/livebar-adds-strip-of-community-to-any-site/)

The concept of LiveBar is very interesting to me. It's like portable social networking for your web site. It will display related social content in a small bar stuck to the bottom of the screen.

## [Paper background graphics](http://cssdivine.com/?page_id=656)

I'm usually against most design fads because they pass so quickly. But if you choose to venture into the grunge fad, this is a very good resource to find those large images of crumpled up paper.
