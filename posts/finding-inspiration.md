From time to time we all hit design funks when inspiration is hard to find and everything we make seems to look like crap (at least I do). Having some solid sources you can fall back on while in a slump can be a great asset.

Most people I ask about inspiration will say something like "Inspiration is everywhere!" Which is true (like telling a sprinter to run faster... thanks coach), but not very helpful when you sitting in a cubical or office and you need to build a comp. And I know, when I'm sitting in a coffee shop relaxing, that last thing I want to do is look around for inspiration or wait for it to hit me.

For many years I've taken inspiration and creativity for granted, but when you go through a time where the ideas aren't firing at you as fast as you'd like, you have to seek them out. Recently I've have to do that; so I thought I'd share my sources.

[EDU Style](http://www.edustyle.net/)

EDU Style is a new source I found. University sites usually have a pretty distinct style, as they convey a different message than most blogs or corporate sites. This is a great source for ideas.

[Design Meltdown](http://www.designmeltdown.com/)

Design Meltdown is a neat gallery run by Patrick McNeil. Thousands of sites to look through. Patrick McNeil gave a real good talk at FOWD08 about finding inspiration, you can view his [presentation slides on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/carsonified/inspiration-design-trends-patrick-mc-neil).

[Daily Design Workout](http://www.jbunti.com/)

Daily Design Workout is a very interesting project. Jonas Buntenbruch posts a new design every day, mostly images, but a very good source of daily inspiration.

[Flickr 7days](http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/)

Flickr 7days shows a random assortment of images that have been uploaded to Flickr in the last 7 days. It's neat to look through, and every once in a while you'll run into a cool picture you can grab some ideas from.

[Twitter public timeline](http://twitter.com/public_timeline)

Millions of people all over the world use Twitter every day, and a lot of them post links. Just go through the public timeline and click some of the links people post, check out the design; you never know what'll be there.

[OpenID site directory](https://www.myopenid.com/directory)

The OpenID site directory is a fairly comprehensive list of all sites that integrate OpenID. It's a massive list of web sites, why not click around?

Doing a Google search for "CSS Gallery" will turn up some good sites too (like [cssmania](http://www.cssmania.com) and [css beauty](http://www.cssbeauty.com/)), but I think most us know about those, so I opted to leave most of them out of my list.

A neat source for typography inspiration is any magazine you can get your hands on. Magazines use so many different typographical styles that by just looking through a few different ones you can a ton of ideas to apply to your site(s).

Those are just a few things I've done to try and get out of a design slump, hopefully they'll be helpful for you.

Where do you get YOUR inspiration?
