<p>The &quot;Home&quot; link has been a staple on almost all of the Web sites I've made in the past 5 years, but lately I've been wondering how important it is.</p>
<p>I heard <a href="http://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug</a> at <a href="http://aneventapart.com/events/boston07/">An Event Apart Boston 2007</a> talk about how the &quot;home&quot; link should always be list first in your navigation, but do we really even need it at all?</p>
<p>All the way back in 2000 <a href="http://www.useit.com">Jakob Nielsen</a> challenged the notion that <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000109.html">we need main navigation</a> on a site. While I do think navigation is important (for most sites), I'm not so sure about the link labeled &quot;Home&quot;. Most of the major sites we all visit have them, but how often are they used?</p>

<p>Let's face it, the home page is even starting to die off. With the influx of RSS and sites like <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a>, <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com">stumbleupon</a>, <a href="http://www.delicious.com">delicious</a>, and countless others, it's very likely that a user will never even see your home page. They'll just jump from article to article through their RSS reader or the latest and greatest from <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> (if you can be so lucky).</p>
<p>UI and user-centric design is so important right now, it has us re-thinking everything about Web development and how we design a site. As I build a site now, I actually stop and analyze every piece of a site from time to time. Everything from the search function to the contents of the footer.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of complaints from users of sites that don't have their logo linked up to the home page, but I've never heard a complaint from someone navigating a site without a home link.</p>
<p>There are some popular sites that have already adopted this style of navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Only the logo will get you to the home page... but i'm sure someone out there will scour those sites for an exception</p>
<p>I think, at this point in the Web, it's perfectly acceptable to drop the &quot;Home&quot; link and use your logo as the only means to get back to your home page. But next time you're putting together a site, really ask yourself: is a &quot;Home&quot; link is adding anything to the user experience, or is it just taking up space?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure mine's just taking up space.</p>
