<p>I generally try and distance myself from unnecessary project overhead, mostly in the form of extra tools hanging around. For that reason, I really never fell in love with task runners like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, but at the same time I see a lot of value in what they do.</p>
<p>One of the major things I do on a project is JavaScript concatenation (and minification), so I was happy to stumble upon this:</p>
<pre><code>cat *.js &gt; app.min.js
</code></pre>
<p>Running that on the command line will concatenate your JavaScript files. Nice little thing to have in your tool belt if you're looking to keep things simple.</p>
<p>This plus a Sass <code>--watch</code> gets me about 90% of the way on most projects.</p>
