Hey all, I realize I don't post all that often any more, but I have a bit of an event coming up that I thought might be noteworthy enough for a blog post.

About 9 months ago I was approached by [Pearson Education](http://www.pearsoned.com/) to write a beginner-level textbook about JavaScript. My first thought was, "oh crap, I need to get a lot better at JavaScript pretty quickly." Well, I think it turned out to be quite a book with some interesting insight (if I do say so). I was able to write in a pretty casual voice and organize it how I felt the topic should be taught. After pushing through a few chapters I started to realize the value in learning JavaScript from a CSS guy, and I ended up really liking the angle at which I came at the topic.

Anyway, I won't keep you too long, but the book is coming out tomorrow (maybe today by the time you read this) and will be available on August 5th. It's called: "[Learning JavaScript: A Hands-On Guide to the Fundamentals of Modern JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Hands-On-Fundamentals-Modern/dp/0321832744/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1343862876&sr=8-13&keywords=learning+javascript)" and it's discounted pretty well right now.

## Where you can buy it:

- [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Hands-On-Fundamentals-Modern/dp/0321832744/ref=sr_1_1) (also for Kindle)
- [Barnes & Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/learning-javascript-tim-wright/1110854170?ean=9780321832740) (also for the Nook)
- I've heard that it'll be on iBooks as well, but I don't have the link yet.

If you want to learn JavaScript from a CSS guy, I hope you give it a read. I think a lot of us came into JavaScript from the CSS angle so I imagine it may be easy to connect with a lot of the topics. If you pick it up, first off, thank you and please let me know your thoughts. I'm definitely interested to hear thoughts on my first attempt in passively educating the masses.
