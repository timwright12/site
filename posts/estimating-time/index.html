<p>Last weekend I was having a yard sale and I woke up at 6am so I could get some things ready, make breakfast, coffee, read a <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batman-2016/batman-16">comic</a>, and have a little time to relax before I had to sit outside for 5 hours and haggle with people over $0.50.</p>
<p>For those who don't know me, I'm a hyper-scheduler. I think of everything I need to do and how long each task takes so I can make sure I stay on time (I hate being late -- in fact, I'd rather be 15 minutes early that 5 minutes late). On this particular morning I had all my things timed out, but there was 1 item that threw me way off and it made me stop and think about how tasks (at work) are estimated and why we &quot;pad&quot; time and give huge ranges.</p>
<p>It was my coffee. Let me walk you through it.</p>

<p>I have a Keurig and it takes about 40 seconds to brew a cup of coffee, but I don't use standard k-cups. I grind whole beans once a week and put them in a reusable cup each time (it saves money, and ya know... the earth). So that adds a little time, but not much. Let's say the estimate for coffee making is: 2 minutes. Sounds like a pretty reasonable estimate for someone using a Keurig, right?</p>
<p>So that was my time estimate, but here's what actually happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had used all the last of the ground coffee the day before</li>
<li>I left the reusable k-cup in the Keurig</li>
<li>The trash was full (you have to empty the k-cup into the trash)</li>
<li>All the coffee mugs where in the dishwasher</li>
</ol>
<p>Now my 2 minute task included: grinding more coffee, taking the trash out, putting a new trash bag in, cleaning a coffee mug, cleaning the used k-cup, and finally brewing the coffee. Then of course, cleaning the now-used k-cup.</p>
<p>All in all, it was about 12mins. So, if I were to use that experience then next time I would have to estimate 2-12 mins to make coffee. 10 minutes for coffee seems like a long time, and an 8 minute buffer window also seems aggressive, but now we know what-all can go wrong so next time my yard sale (aka your project) will start (ship) on time.</p>
<p>That is how time estimates work, and that's why experience matters. Don't be the person who estimates 2 minutes for a cup of coffee and rolls in 10 minutes late with that sweet caffeine.</p>
<p>Or, just drink water in the morning, because it's better for you anyway</p>
