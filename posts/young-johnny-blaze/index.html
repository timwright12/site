<p>Well, I fell asleep after about 20 minutes of Ghost Rider, so i'm giving it another chance. Currently around the 15 minute mark and it's still pretty early; I should make it through this time.</p>
<p>I have no idea why I'm so intrigued by this crappy movie, but I've accepted it. Nicholas Cage + Peter Fonda... honestly, how can you go wrong? YOU CAN'T!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what I'm going to do, since no one reads this stuff anyway, I'm gonna leave this post open for the whole movie and write my comments... should be good.</p>
<p><strong>HERE WE GO:</strong></p>
<p>- Johnny Blaze is eating jelly beans out of a martini glass while that guy from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255734/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255734/">grounded for life</a> is trying to talk him out of jumping his bike over a football field full of cars.</p>
<p>***hold on, I have a phone call***</p>
<p>- OH! Johnny Blaze just went in for the kiss with the stereotypical hot girl who I assume he falls in love with later on... way too early for that</p>
<p>- Johnny's in jail now, getting pissed off. I think he's gonna turn into ghost rider soon, this should be great</p>
<p>- Holy crap this movie is so bad I think I want to see it again. I'm about an hour in at this point.</p>
<p>- he's riding his motorcycle on water and its still flaming - johnny can now turn into ghost rider at will...oh there's another one but he;s on a horse. The horse can go just as fast as the motorcycle. also, the horse is on fire.</p>
<p>ok, peter fonda is back so i'm gonna stop typing now.</p>
<p>verdict: ghost rider is a terrible movie... it makes the list.</p>
<p>with ease, tim</p>
