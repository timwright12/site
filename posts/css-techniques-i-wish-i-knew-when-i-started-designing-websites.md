I know I haven't posted in a while, but I wanted to stop by and let everyone know that I have a new article out on [Noupe.com](http://www.noupe.com/css/css-techniques-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-designing-websites.html) called "[CSS Techniques I Wish I Knew When I Started Designing Websites](http://www.noupe.com/css/css-techniques-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-designing-websites.html)"

It was pretty fun to write trying to think back to my beginnings in the Web and sort of relive that frustration. I tried to include something for beginners and some for the more advanced users, so hopefully everyone will be able to take something away from the article.

Let me know what you think!
