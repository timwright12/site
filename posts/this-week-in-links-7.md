##### [One Click, The Importance of UI](http://www.projectblackfox.com/blog/2008/06/13/one-click-the-importance-of-ui/)

Many times my link lists back up a few weeks and I have to revisit an article to really remember what it was about. When I did that to this one, I moved it up to the top of the list. It's a very interesting article on user interface and the importance of the click. A must-read in my opinion.

##### [Pixel Precision with Diagnostic CSS](http://aloestudios.com/2008/08/pixel-precision-with-diagnostic-css/)

A technique for mocking up a design.

##### [Mint Analytics](http://www.haveamint.com/)

Analytics software I found while muddling through the [An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com) web site.
