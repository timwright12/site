<p>Dave Woods put together a nice article in response to Andy Clarke's article on <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals/">static visuals</a>. I'm linking this one up because I think a lot have already read Andy's and I think Dave did a nice job on this one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my link posts are a little backed up right now, so this is probably a week old at this point. But it's a direct link to the slide show on writing maintainable CSS. I disagree with some of it, but overall, a good presentation.</p>

<p>Ariel is, from what I can gather, awesome, and a consultant for NASA. In this post she described how Twitter is being used on Neptune!</p>
