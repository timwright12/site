<p><strong>CakePHP</strong></p>
<p>It's a widely believed FACT that I'm a PHP n00b. Hardcore programming is not where I make my millions; so when <a href="http://sharkcool.net/" title="http://sharkcool.net/">Shark Cool</a> suggested a PHP framework called <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>, my ears perked up.</p>
<p>When I first got to the site, I looked around, read the documentation and it all sounds great but what the hell does it do? Well, it's supposed to streamline PHP app development. Today I plan on actually reading through the whole manual and really trying to understand more about this stuff that is, apparently, all the rage. Maybe I can actually build something, I think they have a tutorial on building a forum. This should be good, I haven't done anything actually interesting at work in months.</p>
<p><strong>Vancouver</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/?aff=tiwr" title="http://north08.webdirections.org/?aff=tiwr">Web Directions North</a> conference in Vancouver is coming up soon (Jan 28). I'm looking forward to the talk on &quot;Developing with Adobe AIR&quot; and presentations by <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#allsopp">John Allsopp</a> &amp; <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#shea">David Shea</a>, <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#trapani">Gina Trapani</a> (from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/" title="http://lifehacker.com/">LifeHacker</a>) and <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#burka" title="http://north08.webdirections.org/speakers/#burka">Daniel Burka</a> (from <a href="http://www.digg.com/" title="Digg">Digg</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.pownce.com" title="Pownce">Pownce</a>).</p>
<p>It should be a really good conference and I'm excited to get a chance to poke around in Vancouver, rub elbows with some of the people on my bookshelf, and get my first passport stamp.</p>
<p>Currently listening to: <a href="http://www.johnmayertrio.com/" title="http://www.johnmayertrio.com/">John Mayer Trio</a></p>
<p>with general ease, tim</p>
