I wrote an article for [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/tomorrows-css-today "http://www.sitepoint.com/article/tomorrows-css-today") called "Tomorrow's CSS Today: 8 Techniques They Don't Want You To Know" that got published today. Let me know what you think:

With ease,

Also, I'd like to apologize for not participating in [CSS Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/ "http://naked.dustindiaz.com/") this year. With the SitePoint article going live today, I thought it would be a bad time to strip all the CSS from this site. I do, however, fully support it.
