<p>Smashing put out a good article on a topic that I think gets overlooked a lot when dealing with user interface. A lot of times it's taken for granted, but pagination is an important page of the UI.</p>

<p>Freshbooks is a service for the freelancer out there. It's a fast way to track time and invoice your clients. I currently use <a href="http://getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>, but I really like how Freshbooks deals with invoicing</p>

<p>I use fireworks and there are NO good tutorials out there form e. So I was THRILLED to find this link. Photoshop is great and all, but it's a program meant for web &amp; print design. Being a person who doesn't do any print design, a lot of the features in Photoshop are just cruft to me, so I happily use Fireworks.</p>
