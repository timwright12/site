#### Why do web designers complain about typography?

- web fonts are limiting
    - SIFR
    - Font stacks
- complexity
- consistency across platforms

#### Where do you find inspiration?

- print design
- thebookcoverarchive.com
- the content itself

#### Current implementation?

- Don't pretend the Web is a book
- Cambria adoption is around 40%
- questionablecharacters.com
- Try to make the design work with the fonts you have

#### The future of Web typography?

- @font-face{ font-family:barf; src: url(barf.otf/eot); } <â€“need IE if statement for IE .eot font files
- font linking
- .eot as an open format for protection of font files
- loading problems with @font-face since the font has to load
- using an .htaccess file to protect the font from download.
- webfonts.info \[available font with open licensing\]

#### Closing Tips:

- webtypography.net
- pick a normal font and make it good. Don't dwell on what you can't do
- realize the creative potential
    - use letter spacing, text decoration, etc to dress up a standard font
- CSS3 fonts module
- Look up ARC90
- Arial has cross browser weight (bolding) issues, because it's an old forgotten font
