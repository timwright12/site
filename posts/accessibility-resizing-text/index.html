<p>WCAG 2.0 Level AA, Guideline 1.4.4 speaks to the importance of letting the user resize text:</p>
<p>Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.</p>
<p>This guideline states that all website text must be resizable (zoomable). This was more of a problem in older browsers from around 2005 where browsers wouldn’t resize text sizes as pixels or points, but that isn’t an issue anymore as all modern desktop browsers will trigger a full page zoom when the user presses cmd/ctrl+ (Pro Tip: If you set your media queries with EMs instead of PX zooming will also trigger the media query).</p>
