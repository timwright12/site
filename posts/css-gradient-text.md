[CSS Gradient Text demo](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/demo/css-gradient-text/)

It's been a really long time since I've seen someone do a CSS technique and said "wow, that's actually really cool". I was hanging out at [David Shea's Mezzoblue](http://www.mezzoblue.com/ "Mezzoblue") today, and in the sidebar was a link to an article called "CSS Gradient Text". I thought to myself, "great, another stupid CSS trick that ruins markup and CSS". So I click it, read through, and my eyebrow raised (not really, I can't do that). So I looked at the CSS and XHTML; it's actually _not that bad_.

The technique uses a < span > inside and < h1 > to put a transparent PNG gradient. Now, as a semantic markup person I VERY rarely use a < span > because it really doesn't mean anything so I might substitute it with something else, wrap the text and rework some of the CSS. But I like this a lot, I'm all for things that piss off graphic designers and show off how powerful CSS can be (like my [css shevles]/lab/css_shelves/) & [css arrows](/lab/css_arrows/)).

It's very cool, check it out: [CSS Gradient Text demo](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/demo/css-gradient-text/)
