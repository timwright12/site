<p>From time to time we all hit design funks when inspiration is hard to find and everything we make seems to look like crap (at least I do). Having some solid sources you can fall back on while in a slump can be a great asset.</p>
<p>Most people I ask about inspiration will say something like &quot;Inspiration is everywhere!&quot; Which is true (like telling a sprinter to run faster... thanks coach), but not very helpful when you sitting in a cubical or office and you need to build a comp. And I know, when I'm sitting in a coffee shop relaxing, that last thing I want to do is look around for inspiration or wait for it to hit me.</p>
<p>For many years I've taken inspiration and creativity for granted, but when you go through a time where the ideas aren't firing at you as fast as you'd like, you have to seek them out. Recently I've have to do that; so I thought I'd share my sources.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edustyle.net/">EDU Style</a></p>
<p>EDU Style is a new source I found. University sites usually have a pretty distinct style, as they convey a different message than most blogs or corporate sites. This is a great source for ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.designmeltdown.com/">Design Meltdown</a></p>
<p>Design Meltdown is a neat gallery run by Patrick McNeil. Thousands of sites to look through. Patrick McNeil gave a real good talk at FOWD08 about finding inspiration, you can view his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/carsonified/inspiration-design-trends-patrick-mc-neil">presentation slides on SlideShare</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jbunti.com/">Daily Design Workout</a></p>
<p>Daily Design Workout is a very interesting project. Jonas Buntenbruch posts a new design every day, mostly images, but a very good source of daily inspiration.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">Flickr 7days</a></p>
<p>Flickr 7days shows a random assortment of images that have been uploaded to Flickr in the last 7 days. It's neat to look through, and every once in a while you'll run into a cool picture you can grab some ideas from.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/public_timeline">Twitter public timeline</a></p>
<p>Millions of people all over the world use Twitter every day, and a lot of them post links. Just go through the public timeline and click some of the links people post, check out the design; you never know what'll be there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myopenid.com/directory">OpenID site directory</a></p>
<p>The OpenID site directory is a fairly comprehensive list of all sites that integrate OpenID. It's a massive list of web sites, why not click around?</p>
<p>Doing a Google search for &quot;CSS Gallery&quot; will turn up some good sites too (like <a href="http://www.cssmania.com">cssmania</a> and <a href="http://www.cssbeauty.com/">css beauty</a>), but I think most us know about those, so I opted to leave most of them out of my list.</p>
<p>A neat source for typography inspiration is any magazine you can get your hands on. Magazines use so many different typographical styles that by just looking through a few different ones you can a ton of ideas to apply to your site(s).</p>
<p>Those are just a few things I've done to try and get out of a design slump, hopefully they'll be helpful for you.</p>
<p>Where do you get YOUR inspiration?</p>
