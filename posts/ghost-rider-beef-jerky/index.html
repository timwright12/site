<p>I'm in myrtle beach right now, visiting my parents for the holidays. Just laying on the couch watching the new 52&quot; plasma; and Ghost Rider just came on Starz. I'm gonna be honest here, I'm really counting on this movie to be terrible.</p>
<p>I'm talking EPIC-ly terrible, I love those movies that are so bad they're awesome. Some of my favorite terrible movies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloodsport</li>
<li>Kickboxer 3 (with Cody from Step by Step)</li>
<li>Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</li>
<li>Hammerhead</li>
<li>Thumbsucker</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very much hoping to add Ghost Rider to that list tonight.</p>
<p>Also, beef jerky is the perfect road food because the insanely high sodium level allows you to be able to drink water while you drive, but still never have to stop to use the bathroom... great road food.</p>
<p>15 mins into Ghost Rider and its looking pretty promising as young Johnny Blaze just signed a deal with the devil...riveting</p>
<p>with general ease, Tim</p>
