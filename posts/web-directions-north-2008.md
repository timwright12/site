After a smash hit first year in Canada, following several years of great success in Australia, Web Directions North returns to Vancouver, with two days of workshops, a two day conference featuring renowned, inspiring expert speakers from across the globe, and the now legendary post conference trip to Whistler.

Web Directions speakers are real world experts bringing insights, experience and expertise you’ll go a long way to get anywhere else. Our speakers walk the walk, not just talk the talk. You’ll also get the chance to meet, exchange ideas, and network with your peers from across Canada, North America and the World. Web Directions is a must for all designers, developers, product managers, and anyone who works with the web.
