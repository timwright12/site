Back in January I went up to Vancouver for the Web Directions North (WDN) conference ([notes from day 1](http://www.csskarma.com/blog/?p=50 "WDN08 - day 1 notes") - [notes from day 2](http://www.csskarma.com/blog/?p=51 "WDN08 - day 2 notes")). It was a great conference and I meet some really cool people, learned a lot, and got to bring a lot of knowledge about where the web is headed ([beyond the desktop](http://www.webdirections.org/resources/wdn08-allsopp-shea/ "where's your web at?")). Last night I got an e-mail from the folks at WDN about the podcasts and slides from the conference and in the spirit of open source, I thought I'd share:

> Hi there,
> 
> How time flies. Much more than 2 months since Web Directions North. But plenty of time to start putting all the things you learned in January in Vancouver into practice I hope. The really good news is that we've been able to put together an excellent set of resources to refresh your memory. All the slides and podcasts from just about all of the sessions are now available at our resources site. The easiest way to see all of them at once is via the blog post below:

**I'm not sure if I ever thank anyone for visiting my site, so just incase I can't say it in person... thank you and I hope you enjoy the bloggings.**

With ease, Tim
