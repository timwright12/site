<p>Something I seem to do a lot of when writing JavaScript is creating <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/">callback functions</a>. I like them, they help with execution order, and <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/">promises</a> aren't <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises">supported</a> enough for me to make the jump over to them quite yet without a reliable polyfill (although they're very nice). As in anything you need to careful when using callbacks or you'll find yourself in, &quot;callback hell,&quot; as they say (there's also coming called, &quot;promise hell,&quot; so you're doomed either way if you abuse them).</p>
<p>Here's a quick template for creating a method with a callback. Nothing fancy, just a helpful little code snippet I hope you enjoy.</p>
<pre><code>// Always namespacing!
var App = {

  method : function (value, callback) {

    // just doing something generic so we know the method worked
    console.log(value);  

    // make sure the callback argument is a function before calling it
    if (typeof callback === 'function') {

      // call the function
      callback.call( this );

    } // end if
  
  } // end method()

} // end App

// call the method with a callback
App.method('Hey there', function(){
  
  // this is the callback function
  console.log('callback was executed!');

}); // end method call
</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <a href="http://callbackhell.com/">don't abuse the callback</a>.</p>
