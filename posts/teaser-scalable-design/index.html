<p>I want to tell you a story about 95% of design work currently being outputted for the Web and why it doesn't scale.</p>
<p>First off, I feel like I need to explain what a scaling design is exactly. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense since the term &quot;scalability&quot; is tied pretty closely to back end work. When you hear it you think of large elaborate databases, PHP frameworks, cloud computing and high traffic web sites. Not this time though; the scalability of a web site based on traffic, has little or nothing to do with the actual design comp. Of course your code needs to be efficient, but what about your designs?</p>
<p>If I promised you that overall development time can be cut in half with a little forward thinking, would you be interested in something like that? I know I would.</p>
<p>It's not desktop vs. mobile. It's not designing mobile-first. It's not responsive Web design.</p>
<p>It's knowing how to design a scalable web site, a skill that for some reason is escaping many of us... stay tuned for the story.</p>
