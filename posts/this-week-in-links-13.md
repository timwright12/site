##### [Surfin' Safari: CSS Animation](http://webkit.org/blog/324/css-animation-2/)

##### [Get Your Flickr ID](http://idgettr.com/)

I'm currently building a refreshed version of cssKarma.com and I want to display my Flickr photos on the site, but I couldn't find my damn ID to grab the JSON feed. This is a neat little app that can quickly get your Flickr ID.

##### [20 Tips for better Conference Speaking](http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2009/02/20_tips_better_conference_speaking/index.html)
