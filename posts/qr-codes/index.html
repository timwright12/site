<p>Often, when I write something for CSSKarma I try and make it unique rather than picking up the hot topic and throwing my2cents in about it. You may have noticed the lack of HTML 5 posts, even though I <a href="http://csskarma.com/presentations/penn">spoke at the Penn UI</a> Conference about it. There's actually quite a bit buried in the <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/lab">Lab</a> that will surface when I launch the new design.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been playing around with QR codes lately. Seeing what sort of information can be stored in them, if they're a viable technology for the masses, and if they're worth investing in. I thought I'd share my findings.</p>

<p>A QR code is much like a bar code, but they look a lot cooler and in theory can contain a lot more, and a wider variety of information. Everything from plain text to contact information and URLs. They're actually very robust and there's a ton of cool stuff we can do if they ever actually catch on and reach the public.</p>
<p>Most modern phones will have an available app for decoding QR codes. I'm not sure about Blackberry, but I know Android, iPhone and Palm all have free apps.</p>

<p>QR codes can be used for all sorts of things. Anytime you want to transfer data, a QR code can be used. I'm sure there are some limitations on the amount of data, but I haven't encountered it yet. Many times a URL is embedded into the code and then the user is sent out to the Web for more information. This is basically a shortcut to help you get to the data without having to type in a URL (it's actually a pretty big time saver).</p>
<p>One of the best use-cases for QR codes I've seen has been attaching them to a venue. For example: If, on the side of a building, you found a QR code you could decode it to find a calendar of events going on in that building, then choose which ones to add to your calendar, set reminders, etc. All by simply taking a picture of a QR code. Again, a bit time saver.</p>
<p>Since the QR code can basically be an extension of the Web, the possibilities are endless. The problem is... how will we let people know they exist? It's not a problem in the Web community, but based on the speed most technologies like this are adopted, it could be a while.</p>

<p>This is always a debate with a &quot;geek technology&quot;. We can use them, they're very helpful at conferences for passing contact information from person to person or the location of presentation slides. But will everyone else use them? Probably not.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, they're a great technology with endless uses, but I'm not sure they're going to catch on in the way we'd like. They're pretty strange, and no one really knows what they are. They have a along road ahead, much like the way RSS quietly became popular. I think they'll have the same fate in never really being a main stream technology, but stil very popular behind the scenes.</p>
<p>For some reason, these free technologies really struggle but the second Apple charges 99 cents, they take off like a rocket. Here's hoping QR codes make the next Steve Jobs talk?</p>

<p>They are absolutely, 100% worth investing in. The upside of QR codes far outweighs the downside. The <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/lab/qrcodes">QR Code Generator</a> I built took all of 2 hours to fully develop and launch. Most of that time was reading through the Google Charts documentation and testing out all the options.</p>
<p>I don't see any reason we shouldn't explore QR codes more, they have a very promising future and I look forward to see what we can make happen, especially when combined with RDFa, Microformats , and some of the new HTML 5 data embedding.</p>
<h4 id="the-upside" tabindex="-1">The upside <a class="direct-link" href="#the-upside" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>Everyone loves it, you're a genius and you get piles of money handed to you on a daily basis for doing something innovative.</p>
<h4 id="the-downside" tabindex="-1">The downside <a class="direct-link" href="#the-downside" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>Most people many not get it, so they get the information the &quot;old fashion way&quot;. The worst-case scenario is that it totally fails and you wasted 2 hours. It's very much like progressive enhancement for real-life.</p>
