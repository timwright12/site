<p>For years I've always cringed in meetings when managers sitting around a table describe members of their teams as faceless, &quot;resources.&quot; It's come to a point where it almost feels like a swear. I've never liked it because I feel like it dehumanizes people to break them down to a level where they're a set of generic skills to be allocated to a project.</p>
<p>I've caught myself on more than on occasion saying, &quot;You mean <em>people</em>, right? They're <em>people</em>... who sit right over there.&quot;</p>
<p>Believe me, I get the business reason it's done; it's much easier to replace a faceless <em>resource</em> than it is to replace a <em>person</em> you have drinks and lunch with. It's also terminology everyone uses (almost an industry standard at this point). To me, it's weird, really cold, and unnecessary; I try my best to not use it.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say that this isn't really a problem at <a href="http://freshtilledsoil.com">Fresh Tilled Soil</a> (where I work); people are treated like people - it's quite a thing to witness. Every once in a while I'll hear the, &quot;R&quot; word get dropped but it's few and far between.</p>
<p>Try using <em>people</em> or <em>team members</em> next time you need to use the word <em>resources</em> (when talking about projects). It completely changes the tone of the conversation.</p>
