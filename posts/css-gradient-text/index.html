<p>It's been a really long time since I've seen someone do a CSS technique and said &quot;wow, that's actually really cool&quot;. I was hanging out at <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/" title="Mezzoblue">David Shea's Mezzoblue</a> today, and in the sidebar was a link to an article called &quot;CSS Gradient Text&quot;. I thought to myself, &quot;great, another stupid CSS trick that ruins markup and CSS&quot;. So I click it, read through, and my eyebrow raised (not really, I can't do that). So I looked at the CSS and XHTML; it's actually <em>not that bad</em>.</p>
<p>The technique uses a &lt; span &gt; inside and &lt; h1 &gt; to put a transparent PNG gradient. Now, as a semantic markup person I VERY rarely use a &lt; span &gt; because it really doesn't mean anything so I might substitute it with something else, wrap the text and rework some of the CSS. But I like this a lot, I'm all for things that piss off graphic designers and show off how powerful CSS can be (like my <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/lab/css_shelves/">css shevles</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/lab/css_arrows/">css arrows</a>).</p>
