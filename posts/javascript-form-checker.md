I just came across this link that was sent to me about a month ago, it's very cool so I thought I'd share: [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/signup/).You don't have to sign up for anything, I'm posting it, basically, to show the form-checking. Up to now I've been using Dreamweaver’s form validator to check if my forms are complete. It's very easy, but doesn't t really add any \*POP\* to a page.

This is using a [JavaScript](http://timwright12-tagging.jiglu.com/tags/topics/javascript%21overlay "Jiglu topic tag: JavaScript") function to check each form field to see if it’s complete and then producing a check or an 'X' accordingly. Lemme see if I can go a little deeper into that... The JS file is [here](http://static.rememberthemilk.com/js/compiled/rtm.signup.9.js) if you want to take a look at it

A quick way to get this effect would be to download the .js file, mimic the form, and then customize it accordingly. You’ll get a bunch of code you don't need, but it's a lot faster than hacking through the [JavaScript](http://timwright12-tagging.jiglu.com/tags/topics/javascript%21overlay "Jiglu topic tag: JavaScript").

They have a cache function called cacheDom that checks each form field if you're a repeat visitor, you might want to take that out, but otherwise, it's pretty clean script.

I really don't have anything of merit to say, just thought I'd share that link.

With\_ease, Tim
