<p>I figured with the economy what it is and a lot of web folks looking for work I'd help out and post my favorite job site, <a href="http://www.krop.com">Krop.com</a>. I like this site for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found my current job there</li>
<li>They have a very simple interface</li>
<li>You can sign up for e–mail alerts based on a search term. When I was looking for a job in California I signed up to get e–mailed whenever a job came up in the search that had &quot;, CA&quot; in it. So I got all the California web jobs sent to me (and a few Canadian ones). It's very nice.</li>

<p>There's a lot about PHP that I just don't remember off the top of my head and I need to look up. Luckily most of that is listed right here. This article contains things like Smarty, PayPal Integration, access control and caching with PHP.</p>

<p>I'll say it. I think jQuery is massively overused. But since you're using it anyway and you want to display your Tweets, this is a plugin to do just that.</p>

<p>DocStoc is a repository for all kinds of documents. You can get everything from an example of a contract (hint hint to you freelancers) to the guitar tabs for &quot;Smell Like Teen Spirit&quot;</p>
