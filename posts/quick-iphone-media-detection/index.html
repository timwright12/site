<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2008/03/18/mediatyping/">David Shea's post on MediaTyping</a> today and as I was going through it, I asked myself if all the PHP he was using was really necessary. It sure wasn't for what I wanted to do. I just wanted to detect an iPhone or iPod to test out some interfaces.</p>
<p>I did some digging around after that and came across a short post on <a href="http://www.iphoneappr.com/howto.php?id=1">iPhoneAppr</a> about how to auto-detect a browser based on the user agent (what is essentially the browser).</p>
<h4 id="the-http-user-agent" tabindex="-1">The HTTP User Agent <a class="direct-link" href="#the-http-user-agent" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>When you visit a web page, your user agent changes based on the media you're using. So, right now, if you're using Firefox 2 your user agent string looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) 
Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
</code></pre>
<p>and if you're on an iPhone it will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420.1 (KHTML, like 
Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/4A102 Safari/419.3
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the user agent string has some key difference. The iPhone agent actually says &quot;iPhone&quot; in it. With this in mind we can use a neat little function built into PHP 5 called <a href="http://us2.php.net/stripos">stripos</a> to search the user agent and return some code (like code to send someone to a mobile version of a web site).</p>
<p>Let's just get into it shall we? Here's the PHP:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
//setting the variables
ipod = stripos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],&quot;iPod&quot;);
$iphone = stripos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],&quot;iPhone&quot;);

//detecting device
if ($ipod == true || $iphone == true){
    echo &quot;iPhone or iPod&quot;;
    } else {
    echo &quot;Screen&quot;;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>Stripos</code> is a function that takes 2 arguments. The first is what you want to search (the haystack) and the second is what you want to search for (the needle). If the <em>needle</em> is found in the <em>haystack</em> it will return &quot;true&quot;, and if not, it will return false. An important thing to note about <code>stripos</code> is that it's case insensitive[edit], so if you have some initial trouble, check your spacing and maybe try trim().</p>
<h4 id="trouble-i-had" tabindex="-1">Trouble I had <a class="direct-link" href="#trouble-i-had" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>In the PHP manual it says to use === when checking the value (which is for an exact match, true=true), but for some reason that didn't work for me so I used == (match, but not exact so true=true &amp; true=1 for boolean values). It's usually just a spacing issue, but I'm not real sure this time. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I like this, it's pretty easy, light, and useful if you just want an iPhone/iPod interface.</p>
