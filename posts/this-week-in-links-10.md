##### [Krop.com](http://www.krop.com)

I figured with the economy what it is and a lot of web folks looking for work I'd help out and post my favorite job site, [Krop.com](http://www.krop.com). I like this site for a few different reasons:

- I found my current job there
- They have a very simple interface
- You can sign up for e–mail alerts based on a search term. When I was looking for a job in California I signed up to get e–mailed whenever a job came up in the search that had ", CA" in it. So I got all the California web jobs sent to me (and a few Canadian ones). It's very nice.

##### [13 Vital Skills for Every PHP Developer](http://acomment.net/php-tutorials-utopia-13-vital-php-skills-for-every-novice-php-developer-and-solutions/378)

There's a lot about PHP that I just don't remember off the top of my head and I need to look up. Luckily most of that is listed right here. This article contains things like Smarty, PayPal Integration, access control and caching with PHP.

##### [jQuery Twitter Display](http://99atoms.com/post/A-jQuery-TwitterTicker-Plugin.aspx)

I'll say it. I think jQuery is massively overused. But since you're using it anyway and you want to display your Tweets, this is a plugin to do just that.

##### [DocStoc](http://www.docstoc.com/)

DocStoc is a repository for all kinds of documents. You can get everything from an example of a contract (hint hint to you freelancers) to the guitar tabs for "Smell Like Teen Spirit"
