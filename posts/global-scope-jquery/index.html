<p>Before launch of a new site, I always take the time to run my JavaScript through a checker. Personally, I use <a href="http://jslint.com/">JS Lint</a>. It's not the prettiest thing, but it works great to pick up small errors and elements of bad practice. You'll get alerts like &quot;unused variable&quot;, &quot;don't use eval(), it's evil&quot;, &quot;implied global&quot;.</p>
<p>I find that it's best not to argue with JS Lint, just fix the problem.</p>
<p>One that I had encountered quite a bit while running jQuery through JS Lint was &quot;Implied global: $&quot;.</p>
<p>Up until a week or two ago, I was just blowing it off, because, I mean, come on, it's a $, it kind of is global when using jQuery. For whatever reason I had a quick talk with <a href="http://twitter.com/akira_x">@akira_x</a> and we figured out what was going on and how to fix it.</p>
<p>The solution is actually similar to how we build jQuery plugins, but without the real plugin model, just normal site code.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-of-the-the-document.ready" tabindex="-1">Evolution of the the document.ready <a class="direct-link" href="#evolution-of-the-the-document.ready" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>When jQuery first came out, this is how we would used document.ready as a wrapper for custom jQuery:</p>
<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
// jquery code here
 });
</code></pre>
<p>Then we moved on to the short cut method:</p>
<pre><code>$(function(){
// jquery code here
});
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these methods are technically fine, but they both leave &quot;$&quot; as an implied global. This may not be an issue for most of us since we only use jQuery, so who really cares is $ is global, right?</p>
<p>We can, however make sure (just in case, because we're all good coders) that there are no future library or JavaScript collisions by containing the scope of $ with:</p>
<pre><code>(function($) {
	// jquery here
}(jQuery));
</code></pre>
<p>This will still cause JS Lint to throw an &quot;implied global&quot; alert, but it will be for &quot;jQuery&quot; rather than &quot;$&quot;. Personally, I feel like it's better.</p>
