#### How to Respond to Feedback

##### step 1

Appreciation - "Thank you"

##### step 2

Acknowledgment

- understanding before you act. ask further questions if you don't understand
- words matter (being blunt isn't an excuse)

##### step 3

Consideration

- finding the value in feedback, how you can apply it
- strip away the negative
- isn't always actionable
- be honest (if you can't do it, need to think about it, etc.)
- give accurate expectations
- don't say the word "no", soften it up

#### Social Architecture by Christina Wodtke (Day Stage) - boxesandarrows.com

- slides on slideshare.net
- behavior is a function of the person + the environment
- you can only control the environments
- Gene Smith's model
- A group is it's own worst enemy - shirky.com/writings/group\_enemy.html
- need to have visitor identities
- make the default avatar ugly so people want to change it
- identity is context based
- presence (status, history, signs of life \[last logged in\])
- reputation system can be insulting to a small group
- it's good for large groups like amazon
- there must be a cost to join (from registration form to monthly fee)
- building relationships (groups of some kind)
- ways to track people you're interested in
- facilitating conversation between users
- sharing information
- segregating a social site by demographic if you're trying to cover a wide audience
- look for a real-world equivalent and try to mimic the behavior on your site
