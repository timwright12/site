<p>I just came across this link that was sent to me about a month ago, it's very cool so I thought I'd share: <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/signup/">Remember the Milk</a>.You don't have to sign up for anything, I'm posting it, basically, to show the form-checking. Up to now I've been using Dreamweaver’s form validator to check if my forms are complete. It's very easy, but doesn't t really add any *POP* to a page.</p>
<p>This is using a <a href="http://timwright12-tagging.jiglu.com/tags/topics/javascript%21overlay" title="Jiglu topic tag: JavaScript">JavaScript</a> function to check each form field to see if it’s complete and then producing a check or an 'X' accordingly. Lemme see if I can go a little deeper into that... The JS file is <a href="http://static.rememberthemilk.com/js/compiled/rtm.signup.9.js">here</a> if you want to take a look at it</p>
<p>A quick way to get this effect would be to download the .js file, mimic the form, and then customize it accordingly. You’ll get a bunch of code you don't need, but it's a lot faster than hacking through the <a href="http://timwright12-tagging.jiglu.com/tags/topics/javascript%21overlay" title="Jiglu topic tag: JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>They have a cache function called cacheDom that checks each form field if you're a repeat visitor, you might want to take that out, but otherwise, it's pretty clean script.</p>
<p>I really don't have anything of merit to say, just thought I'd share that link.</p>
<p>With_ease, Tim</p>
