<p>This morning I discovered one of the best write ups on responsive design I've read since this whole movement started. I 'gent by the name of <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/about/">Steven Bradley</a> wrote a piece about the lessons he learned from a responsive process. I like that he talks about the general steps of the process and then the lessons learn. Very good read.</p>
