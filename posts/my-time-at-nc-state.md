About 3 years ago a fairly young department at NC State hired a 23 year old kid from Massachusetts who constantly made claims that CSS was the future of web development. I was that kid; And I condemned them all for their table-based web sites, then promptly converted them to CSS.

NC State provided me with great professional development opportunities, conferences, training materials, R&D time, and an environment where there is a ton a room for personal growth. While I'm sure that the casual demeanor of the office will go unmatched, sometimes you have to look at yourself, where you are and realize that it's time to move on. It's certainly no reflection on the University, the department, or the people. I love them all and will have plenty of fond memories of my time there. It's all great stuff.

Working on countless projects just because I felt like learning something new was a great experience. And a fantastic way to built a skill set.

I'm sure that for years to come I'll be telling stories about the office antics, arguments, banter and hoisting a brew every Thursday after work just to vent about the week. Those nights at [Sammy’s](http://www.sammysncsu.com/ "http://www.sammysncsu.com/") were something great.

But, as sad as it is to end an epic era, when it's time to move on, it's time to move on. Over the next few weeks I'll be making the move out to Los Angeles to start work at [USC Web Services](http://www.usc.edu/its/webservices "ITS web services"). I just felt that the opportunity was too good to pass up. While I'm there, I'm sure my thoughts will stray every once in a while back to that office I first stepped into back in 2005 and I might even crack a smile :o).

So long everyone, it’s been great and I appreciate everything you’ve done. I can honestly say that I don’t know where I would be if it wasn’t for the folks at [NC State DELTA](http://delta.ncsu.edu "delta")
