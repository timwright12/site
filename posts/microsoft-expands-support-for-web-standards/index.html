<p>Ran into this link today, thought I'd share: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/mar08/03-03WebStandards.mspx">Microsoft Standards</a></p>

<p>Looks like the IE team created a really complex system to account for all the uproar in the web community. Seems to be a large step in the right direction. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/comments/minorthreat?page=5#49">Didn't someone say this would happen</a>?</p>
<p>Either way, I still think it's a good thing and I really hope Microsoft does a better job at upgrading IE7 folks to IE8 than they did for IE6 users.</p>
<p>Just a quick post today.</p>
