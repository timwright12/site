For years I've always cringed in meetings when managers sitting around a table describe members of their teams as faceless, "resources." It's come to a point where it almost feels like a swear. I've never liked it because I feel like it dehumanizes people to break them down to a level where they're a set of generic skills to be allocated to a project.

I've caught myself on more than on occasion saying, "You mean _people_, right? They're _people_... who sit right over there."

Believe me, I get the business reason it's done; it's much easier to replace a faceless _resource_ than it is to replace a _person_ you have drinks and lunch with. It's also terminology everyone uses (almost an industry standard at this point). To me, it's weird, really cold, and unnecessary; I try my best to not use it.

I'm happy to say that this isn't really a problem at [Fresh Tilled Soil](http://freshtilledsoil.com) (where I work); people are treated like people - it's quite a thing to witness. Every once in a while I'll hear the, "R" word get dropped but it's few and far between.

Try using _people_ or _team members_ next time you need to use the word _resources_ (when talking about projects). It completely changes the tone of the conversation.
