Hi all, I had a new article published over the weekend at Smashing Magazine. Check it out and let me know what you think!

[Behavioral CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/19/what-you-need-to-know-about-behavioral-css/)

I wrote it quite a while ago and it seems to be showing a bit in the comments, but overall, I'm pretty happy with the way it came out and the reader responses it's getting. Hope you enjoy [Behavioral CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/19/what-you-need-to-know-about-behavioral-css/)
