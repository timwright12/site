<p>I know I haven't posted in a while, but I wanted to stop by and let everyone know that I have a new article out on <a href="http://www.noupe.com/css/css-techniques-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-designing-websites.html">Noupe.com</a> called &quot;<a href="http://www.noupe.com/css/css-techniques-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-designing-websites.html">CSS Techniques I Wish I Knew When I Started Designing Websites</a>&quot;</p>
<p>It was pretty fun to write trying to think back to my beginnings in the Web and sort of relive that frustration. I tried to include something for beginners and some for the more advanced users, so hopefully everyone will be able to take something away from the article.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
