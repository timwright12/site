In vancouver at WDN08. Just heard Jeffery Zeldman agree with me on how to get work done. I'm sitting in room 2 right now waiting for Derek Featherstone to talk about Real World Accessibility... should be good, will report back later.

**DEREK FEATHERSTONE - REAL WORLD ACCESSIBILITY**

- go beyond the section 508 checklist
- usability issues magnify with disabled users
- extra punctuation cases problems \[keyword(s):\]
- term "news" implies that there is an archive
- make sure things have a logical linear flow
- maintain action focus on a page change (different than a page refresh)

Google maps

- voice recognition grid for map clicking
- they use onClick div for map controls
- ironFeathers replaces this with a styled button element which is more accessible

\-----------

- Focus on task by user rather than for a software (jaws)
- "makes stuff work" rather than "make stuff work for this browser"
- _everyone_ still uses baseCamp
- greasemonky is a good solution for individual user needs (js/css)

Proximity

- WAI:ARIA
- role="alert"
- WAI:ARIA support is coming soon

Sitting in a talk by Tara Hunt right now. about how Web2.0 is more about the people than the technology. Not sure how many notes I can get from this, but so far it's a good talk.

**TARA HUNT - GOVERNMENT 2.0**

- TransitCamp \[people wanting to improve transit websites\]
- people "demanding" the web applications \[ex. California wildfire google map/flickr tracking photos\]
- fixMyStreet (uk)
- web mashups to create web 2.0 apps that people want
- "fair copyright for canada" Facebook group stopped legislation
- library of congress flickr account

How to encourage collaboration

1. release an API - make data available
2. publish everything openly (mockup designs to flickr)
3. be available for comments/questions
4. embrace the chaos - don't be afraid to fail
5. reward contributors
6. show progress
7. take small, simple steps \[not shocking to the user and easier to reverse\]
8. reach out to people from different backgrounds
9. view the public as a partner, not a recipient
10. run real, open, betas \[let people know its a beta and that you want feedback\]

_Government 2.0 = trust_

**JONATHAN SNOOK - AJAX FRAMEWORKS**

- Frameworks in 3 layers
- DOM
- Application conventions (call to the server)
- widgets (ex. lightbox)

Popular frameworks

1. Prototype -> for data heavy stuff
2. jquery -> heavy DOM work
3. Extjs -> application widgets
4. script.aculo.us -> animation
5. MooTools -> a little bit of everything
6. YUI -> a lot of everything
7. Dojo -> application widgets

**JARED SPOOL - INTUITIVE DESIGN**

- Designs don't intuit anything, they just sit there
- intuitive is personal
- what users currently know based on past experiences
- we are constantly using language our users don't understand
- intuitive design in evolutionary
- current knowledge is what the user knows
- target knowledge is what users need to know to complete a given task
- The "gap" is the area between current and target knowledge, this is where design happens \[trying to bridge the "gap"\]
- a wizard MUST be in the gap
- hide complexity by upgrading in smaller steps
- reducing target knowledge is necessary to make design seem intuitive
- www.uie.com/brainsparks
- Making things easy to discover
- "exploratory discoverability" - finding stuff as you go
- give clues - lack of clues prevents productivity

**GINA TRAPINI - BETTER GMAIL**

- greasemonky for JS
- stylish for CSS
- remember the milk in GMail
- diveintogreasemonky.org
