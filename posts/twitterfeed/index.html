<p>I get a lot of questions about how I share <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/csskarma/status/72737431920713728">articles on Twitter</a>, so I though I would just write it up real quick since I just synced up some more accounts to my stream.</p>
<p>I do most of my article gathering through <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, which has a &quot;share&quot; option at the bottom of each article you read. If you follow me on Google, you probably get these articles in the &quot;shared by others&quot; category, but for those of you who don't, I use the RSS feed of shared items that Reader puts out piped through an RSS to Twitter service (personally, I use <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">TwitterFeed</a>).</p>
<p>It's not a perfect service, it will only push out articles every 30mins or so, but I find it more than adequate for my purposes. If something really great comes along and TwitterFeed isn't an option, I sometimes push it out by hand to Twitter. And I actually think the 30mins delay is a good buffer so I don't flood anyone's Twitter stream with articles.</p>
<p>Google Reader also has a bookmarklet for things you want to share that's outside your subscriptions. It's very nice, I highly recommend it. You can get the RSS feed and &quot;Note in Reader&quot; bookmarklet from the &quot;<a href="http://twitpic.com/20tk6e">Share</a>&quot; tab down the left side of the page.</p>
<p>That's how you get the Tweets formatted like &quot;Currently reading&quot; and &quot;From CSSKarma&quot;. I also recently hooked up Pandora, LastFM and YouTube to the services... so look out.</p>
