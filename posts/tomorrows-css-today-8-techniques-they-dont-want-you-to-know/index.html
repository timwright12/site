Let me know what you think:</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to apologize for not participating in <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/" title="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a> this year. With the SitePoint article going live today, I thought it would be a bad time to strip all the CSS from this site. I do, however, fully support it.</p>
