<p>Personally, I think animation should be left to JavaScript, but this is actually pretty neat, you have to download the <a href="http://webkit.org/">open source version of WebKit</a> to see it, but it's definitely worth a look into the future of CSS.</p>

<p>I'm currently building a refreshed version of <a href="http://cssKarma.com">cssKarma.com</a> and I want to display my Flickr photos on the site, but I couldn't find my damn ID to grab the JSON feed. This is a neat little app that can quickly get your Flickr ID.</p>

<p>Cameron Moll lists out 20 great points on how to grab your audience while speaking. Since I know I have this problem from time to time, I thought this was an excellent read and very shareâ€“worthy.</p>

<p>Aviary is like an online version of PhotoShop. But that's not why they're on this list, I think I've actually posted this link before; but now they have a real slick new navigation menu that I LOVE. Check this out, it's very interesting.</p>
