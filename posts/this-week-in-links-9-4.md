I'd like to try and start sharing some links once a week with everyone since I'm settling into a new job and I don't want my posts to become few and far between. Just to let you know that I am doing some interesting things right now, but have just run a little short on time. Here are some links that grabbed my attention:

#### Some sites to be aware of:

##### [Script & Style](http://scriptandstyle.com/ "Script and Style")

Script & Style is a new site by Chris Coyier and David Walsh. The best way I can describe it is like subscribing to the CSS/JS search term RSS feed on [Digg](http://digg.com/search?section=all&s=css), but a little more interesting. There are user-submitted articles, like Digg, but you don't have to filter out all that Digg-esk junk like articles about hamburger grease and bicycle chains. You just get the stuff you want. I like it, at least subscribe to the RSS feed, it's well worth the visit.

##### Google Chrome bugs - [Alternate Style Sheets](http://www.zeldman.com/2008/09/03/a-bug-in-google-chrome/) and [Max/Min-width](http://www.european-viewpoint.com/nekkid-blogger/htmlcss-bugs-in-chrome/)

The big news for the week seemed to be about Google's web browser, Chrome. Everyone seems to love it (I couldn't install it on my parallel, I'll try on Vista later on), but there are some bugs reported with it. I guess that's why Google leaves everything in Beta for a decade.

##### [Animation Jump in JQuery](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/animation-jump-quick-tip/)

When I first saw this quick tip from JQuery for Designers I really didn't see a major need for it. But as I kept seeing it in my news feed it actually grew on me. It creates a nice sliding effect for anchor links, worth poking around with. I really don't like dumping a ton of JavaScript into my pages, but for a JS light page, or an FAQ, this might be a nice feature.

##### [Using JQuery UI to Control Text Size](http://nettuts.com/javascript-ajax/use-the-jquery-ui-to-control-the-size-of-your-text/)

I love [Nettuts](http://nettuts.com), every week they come out with some really cool tricks. This is one of those things that is a really nice tool to have in your library just in case you need it. I could see this being very useful for reading documents online or just zooming in on an app.

##### [Automatic Awesompersands](http://patrickhaney.com/thinktank/2008/08/19/automatic-awesompersands)

YAJQPI I guess, but I kind like this one. It searches through your content to find and restyle ampersands, giving them a hip designer/small coffee shop look by wrapping a span around them (sidenote: are we using spans too much with jQuery?).

##### [JavaScript in Modern Web Design](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/general/javascript-in-modern-web-design/)

Web Designer Wall is a pretty popular blog (more so than this one), so I'm sure most have seen this already, but it's still worth mentioning just in case. Nick La lists out and describes virtually every JavaScript you will commonly find in web design today. If nothing, it's a great reference list.

Today seemed to be a little JavaScript heavy, but I guess that's what's going on right now as we're all in our JQuery phase.
