I get a lot of questions about how I share [articles on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/csskarma/status/72737431920713728), so I though I would just write it up real quick since I just synced up some more accounts to my stream.

I do most of my article gathering through [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader), which has a "share" option at the bottom of each article you read. If you follow me on Google, you probably get these articles in the "shared by others" category, but for those of you who don't, I use the RSS feed of shared items that Reader puts out piped through an RSS to Twitter service (personally, I use [TwitterFeed](http://twitterfeed.com)).

It's not a perfect service, it will only push out articles every 30mins or so, but I find it more than adequate for my purposes. If something really great comes along and TwitterFeed isn't an option, I sometimes push it out by hand to Twitter. And I actually think the 30mins delay is a good buffer so I don't flood anyone's Twitter stream with articles.

Google Reader also has a bookmarklet for things you want to share that's outside your subscriptions. It's very nice, I highly recommend it. You can get the RSS feed and "Note in Reader" bookmarklet from the "[Share](http://twitpic.com/20tk6e)" tab down the left side of the page.

That's how you get the Tweets formatted like "Currently reading" and "From CSSKarma". I also recently hooked up Pandora, LastFM and YouTube to the services... so look out.
