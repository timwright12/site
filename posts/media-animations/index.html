<p>I've been doing a lot with <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Design</a>, Media Queries (yea, they're different), and light transitions with CSS 3 lately and something kind of cool happened. By sheer accident I put a transition inside a media query, resized my window and watch the padding on my <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element animate to it's new value.</p>
<p>It was way cool. check out a quick <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/lab/media-animations/">demo I threw together</a>.</p>
<p>I inserted 2 breakpoints in the demo. One at 800px and another at 480px, so you should see the design adjust twice.</p>
<h2 id="the-css" tabindex="-1">The CSS <a class="direct-link" href="#the-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<pre><code>header h1 a,
article h1,
article h2,
article{
     -moz-transition: all .5s linear;
     -webkit-transition: all .5s linear;
     transition: all .5s linear;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Put that in with the base CSS (not the media query) and you'll get a nice animation effect as you resize the browser window.</p>
<p>You can't animate all the properties, but things like: color, margin, padding, color, font-size, etc are all fair game. I've mostly been using transitions for softening hover effect lately, but I think this, if tastefully done, can be a nice hidden (and light weight) gem.</p>
