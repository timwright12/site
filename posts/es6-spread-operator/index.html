<p>I got a little sidetracked.</p>
<p>This post was suppose to be about <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Strings?hl=en">Tagged Template Strings</a>, but in my search for a real-life usage example of async loading data and a template (separately), then mashing them together (I couldn't really find one) I kept seeing a weird operator in the function examples. <strong>It was an ellipsis</strong>. I really hadn't see it before, but I could kinda tell what it was doing, so I continued down the path of Tagged Templates. Initially I thought it was pseudo code, but after seeing it a few times, I figured it was something in ES6.</p>
<p>When I realized that I needed to actually learn what this weird argument was, I stopped and Googled, &quot;JavaScript ellipsis argument.&quot; What came back was the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator">spread operator</a></em>.</p>

<p>The spread operator is a way to pass a lot of data (an array) into a function. An example:</p>
<pre><code>function wickedAwesome(...data){
  console.log(data); // Array[1] (the actual object)
}

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

wickedAwesome(numbers);
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I can tell this is different from passing the array directly because the latter will return the individual array items rather than the array object (try it).</p>
<p>This sort of function argument also works in reverse:</p>
<pre><code>function wickedAwesome(x, y, z){
  console.log(x); // 1
  console.log(y); // 2
  console.log(z); // 3
}

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

wickedAwesome(...numbers);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also inject data into an array (which is kinda cool), mozilla uses this example:</p>
<pre><code>var parts = ['shoulders', 'knees'];
var lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes'];

console.log(lyrics); // header, shoulders, knees, and, toes
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, I think the spread operator is pretty cool, support isn't great, but what is in ES6?</p>
