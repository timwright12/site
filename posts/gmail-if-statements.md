Last night I went to the Celtics/Clippers game in LA. Boston lost, but it was a [great game](http://picasaweb.google.com/timwright12/2009CelticsClippers#); right down to the wire. Anyway, that's not the purpose of this write–up.

When I got home, I uploaded the pictures and e–mailed them out to my family (as I do). I sent them out to dad, mom, sister, and my uncle.

I wrote out the e–mail, and at the end I wanted to thank my Uncle for the tickets, but I thought it would be weird for the rest of the people to see "Thanks for the tickets uncle Jim" at the bottom of the e–mail. So instead, I wrote a second e–mail thanking for the tickets. I know e–mail is pretty "green", but I found this to be a very fixable issue to save that second e–mail from clogging up inboxes.

This actually happens to me quite a bit for some reason, and most of the time I just don't send the second e–mail. So I got to thinking and I'd like it if GMail (the masters of web they are) could implement some sort of conditional statement to section off an e–mail.

##### The GMail If Statement:

```
{if:recipient="myuncle@example.com"}
Thanks for the tickets!
{/if}
```

I could have e–mailed Google about this, but in the past that's never worked so I thought I'd write something up and turn to the community about it.

Anyway, I think this is a cool idea, if you agree and think it's a feature that could benefit you in GMail, please leave a comment, share, [digg](http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.csskarma.com/blog/gmail-if-statements/), whatever. And maybe it'll make it's way back to Google.

Even if it's only applicable to GMail recipients, could be cool and a simple feature to add in. I'd rather see it as a GMail feature than a Greasemonkey script, but hey... I'd use it either way!
