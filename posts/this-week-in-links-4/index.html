<p>Ever since Opera accepted that no one uses their browser for general browsing they've been huge activists for the semantic web, and this yet another example of what they're doing to help the web evolve and educate the masses. Kudos to Opera. This should be required reading for all new developer/designers and even clients.</p>

<p>Fluid app is something I've been looking into for a little while now. I normally wouldn't put this up here, because it's a macâ€“only application; but it seems really neat. It creates desktop apps from web sites, like a bunch of little stand alone browsers in your doc. It does a similar thing to Google Chrome, by modularizing your web apps so if one crashes everything doesn't fail.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly how this site evaded my RSS reader for so long, but it's a very informative 'zine about the web. When I first saw it I read through a few articles and really liked what I saw.</p>

<p>Hngry is the lunch time app we all wanted, but are <a href="http://projects.csskarma.com/lunch/">too lazy</a> to build. It's very nice, but it needs a lot more data.</p>
